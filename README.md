#description
The "Intelligent Traffic Signal Management System for Emergency Vehicles Using IoT and ML" is a cutting-edge solution designed to address the challenges faced by emergency vehicles in navigating congested urban traffic. Leveraging advanced technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning (ML), this system aims to prioritize the passage of emergency vehicles at traffic signals, thereby minimizing response time and enhancing overall safety.

The system operates by equipping emergency vehicles with LoRa (Long Range) communication technology, allowing seamless communication with traffic signals. Through real-time data transmission, the system detects approaching emergency vehicles and dynamically adjusts traffic signal timings to prioritize their passage. ML algorithms analyze traffic patterns and predict optimal routes for emergency vehicles, ensuring swift and efficient navigation through congested intersections.

The system's implementation involves the integration of hardware components such as LoRa transmitters/receivers and microcontrollers, as well as software development for system logic and user interfaces. Testing and validation of the system's performance under various scenarios are crucial to ensure its reliability and effectiveness in real-world environments.

Overall, the Intelligent Traffic Signal Management System represents a significant advancement in urban traffic management, offering a proactive solution to enhance emergency response capabilities and improve the safety and efficiency of urban transportation systems.
