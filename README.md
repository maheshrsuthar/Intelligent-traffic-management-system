# Intelligent Traffic Signal Management System

## Overview
The Intelligent Traffic Signal Management System is a project aimed at addressing the challenges faced by emergency vehicles in navigating congested urban traffic. Leveraging IoT (Internet of Things) and ML (Machine Learning) technologies, this system prioritizes emergency vehicle passage at traffic signals, minimizing response time and enhancing overall safety.

## Key Features
- Real-time detection and prioritization of emergency vehicles.
- Dynamic adjustment of traffic signal timings based on ML algorithms.
- User-friendly interface for emergency vehicle drivers.
- Efficient and automated traffic flow management.
